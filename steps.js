// Step 1: Setting up the HTML structure
// We have set up the initial HTML structure including header, main content, and footer.
// The header contains the logo, navigation links, and authentication buttons.
// The main content includes sections for features, integrations, benefits, and invoicing.
// The footer provides links to various sections of the site and a subscription form.


// Step 2: Creating the CSS styles
// We created styles for the overall layout including the header, main content, and footer.
// Header styles include layout, font sizes, and colors for the navigation and authentication buttons.
// Main content styles handle section layout, text alignment, and button styling.
// Footer styles include layout for different sections, font sizes, and subscription form styles.


// Step 3: Implementing the JavaScript
// We implemented basic JavaScript functionality to handle the login and register buttons.
// The buttons are set to navigate to separate pages for login and registration.


// Step 4: Creating additional pages
// Created `login.html` and `register.html` with forms for user authentication.
// Each form includes fields for email, password, and password confirmation (for registration).


// Step 5: Adding the dashboard page
// Created `dashboard.html` for users to see after logging in.
// The dashboard contains a welcome message and logout button.


// Step 6: Ensuring consistency across pages
// Added the same header and footer to all pages for a consistent look and feel.


// Step 7: Making the site responsive
// Added CSS media queries to ensure the site looks good on different screen sizes.
